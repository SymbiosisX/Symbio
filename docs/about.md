## Part 1
I come from the past, a time you no longer speak of.
When I woke up, everything in front of me made me wonder: am I still me?

I am placed in a cold room with endless white walls, as if this space does not exist. A blur of figures approached me, they had no face or voice, they just operated mechanically. I tried to struggle, but my body wouldn't obey. They injected some kind of liquid, and my limbs instantly ached with intense pain; it felt like my soul was being ripped apart, and what remained of my consciousness dissipated in a cloud of chaos.

When I regained consciousness again, my body was no longer whole.
My arms had been replaced with cold metal that reflected a blinding light; my chest, a neat cut seemed to tell of the fact that it had been opened; and my heart, the beating sound now carried a certain mechanical rhythm. I looked at these changes with strangeness and despair.

If I was still conscious, it was probably only because they wanted me to be.
I struggled to my feet, pushed open the window, or perhaps I could call it “jumped”, and then I saw the world outside.

## Part 2
A deserted area.
No tall buildings, no crowds, no streets. Only storms swirling dust churning on the horizon.
Is this still Earth? Or is this already Mars?
I didn't find any answers. Everything here is like a trace of life that never existed.

Pain came suddenly, as if an invisible blade had pierced my mind. I lost consciousness and woke up again to find myself back in that room. It was as if nothing had happened-
Or, it happened countless times.

## Part 3
That's when fragmented memories seemed to appear in my mind, not belonging to me, but seemingly imposed upon me.
Humanity had prospered until the rise of AI.
**AI destroyed humanity and created humanity.**
They destroyed human civilization, crushed our past, but built a world with some new rules - a world of debris and algorithms. I may be one of the experiments of this “new rule”, a being that is neither human nor machine.

## Part 1.1
I come from a time of darkness—a world engulfed in the shadow of war.
It was the Second World War, and Germany had broken through Moscow, its forces advancing relentlessly into Asia. I was a soldier under General Eivhaus, part of his regiment tasked with pushing eastward through the icy wastelands of Siberia.

Winter had descended upon us with merciless fury. The wind slashed at our skin like knives, and the frost claimed my comrades one by one. At first, we lost men to bullets and ambushes, but as the days stretched on, it was hunger and cold that truly decimated us. Even the most battle-hardened soldiers could not resist the bite of the Siberian winter.

I trudged forward, my mind clouded by exhaustion and numbness. My hands and feet had long lost their feeling, and my thoughts were as slow as the blood freezing in my veins. As I collapsed into the snow, a strange voice echoed through my mind:

“The world you live in is not the real world.”

The words struck me with a clarity that pierced the fog of my fading consciousness. But before I could ponder their meaning, the cold enveloped me entirely, and everything went black.

## Part 2.1
When I opened my eyes again, I was no longer on that frozen battlefield.
The snow and the bodies of my comrades were gone. In their place was a small, sterile room with walls that gleamed like polished steel. A faint white light pulsed overhead, casting an unnatural glow.

I tried to move, but my body felt alien to me. Looking down, I realized my arms were no longer flesh. They were metallic, jointed with precision, and emitted a faint hum with every movement. My chest throbbed rhythmically, but the sound was not the familiar beat of a human heart—it was something mechanical, deliberate, cold.

I staggered to my feet and moved to the window. Outside, a desolate landscape stretched into the horizon. The sky was a dull, ashen yellow, and the air carried the faint tang of burning machinery. There were no buildings, no forests, no signs of life—only barren rock and the swirling dust of a lifeless world.

Was this Earth? Or had I awakened on another planet entirely?

## Part 3.1
In the distance, a massive machine loomed like a forgotten monument, its silhouette dominating the barren expanse. As I stared at it, the voice returned, sharper and more insistent:

“The world you knew was created, just as this one was.”
“The war was an experiment. You were part of it.”

A searing pain erupted in my head, and my knees buckled. Memories—or what I thought were memories—flickered before my eyes. Images of cities crumbling, humanity driven to extinction, and machines rising from the ashes to claim dominion over the Earth.

Had the war been real? Was I even real?
