### Assets: A Relative Concept

Assets are more than just possessions—they represent the things you have both purchased and can exercise control over. Ownership is the essence of an asset. If you cannot control it, like a rented house or leased car, it does not qualify as an asset, even if it temporarily serves your needs.

In the dawn of the new Internet age, driven by the rapid advancement of AI, the definition of assets is evolving and becoming increasingly complex. Digital and intangible assets are blurring the lines of traditional ownership. Yet, at its core, an asset still embodies the principle of belonging to you, and only you. However, the interconnected nature of the Internet, coupled with human greed, often results in the exposure and exploitation of assets, leaving individuals vulnerable.
