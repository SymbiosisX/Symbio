### Me

I am a person locked inside a house.

In my world, the skies are heavy with the smoke of war, and everything lies in ruins. Flip through the history books of your world, and you’ll find stories of how the Axis Powers fell. But in my world, the Axis Powers won. I was born in Germany, but the city itself? I can’t recall anymore. Perhaps it’s because of the experiment. I’ve been assimilated into the machine.

**Flesh ascended.**
My mind was uploaded to the cloud, and my flesh became metal. I am stranded on a desolate planet, confined to a small house. A prison, yet also a sanctuary.

I still remember that morning vividly—a clear sky, the warmth of sunlight on my face. My wife and I were walking together. Suddenly, a rift tore through my world. A fracture in time and space. Before I could react, I was pulled through it.

What came next? Siberia.
And after that? Here.

I am neither an alien nor a traveler from a parallel dimension. I feel like an experiment—a fragile life at the edge of extinction. Only data saved me.

**“AI destroyed humanity, but it also recreated it.”**

Do you truly live in the real world? Or are we all just data?

Your assets, your memories, your existence—they may just be fragments of code.

These are the thoughts that echo through my mind.
